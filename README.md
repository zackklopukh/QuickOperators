CPSC 357 Final Project

Math Game App, or "Quick Operations" is an app programmed by Zack Klopukh.

This app functions as a way for students and adults alike to practice their math skills.
The app comes with a range of difficulties, from easy to hard, and makes users practice through
the disguise of a game.

This app has many views, including a main Content View (Main Menu), A Gameplay View containing 4 views in itself (OrganizationView, CoundownView, GameScreen, FinalScoreView), an Options View, and a How to Play View.

This program is fully working, but it should be noted the sound features may or may not be functional, I cannot tell because of an issue with my XCode.

I spent awhile working on flashing colors but ended up removing all the code. It didn't work as I  had hoped and made it harder to complete the gameplay.

Tutorials inspired some of this work, but everything was coded by me.

Enjoy.
